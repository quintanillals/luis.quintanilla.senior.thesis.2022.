  <h1>
    I  reflected upon this poem deeply;
  </h1>
  <p>You do know why you're here, don't you?</p>
  <p>
    Yes. There is great confusion on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following: '<mark class="pink">Perfect man</mark> has visited earth already, and his voice was heard. The voice of <mark class="pink">imperfect man</mark> must now be made manifest,' and I have been selected as the most likely candidate.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time is <mark class="pink">June</mark>, therefore, you, a gemini, must go. To be born under <mark class="pink">twin signs twice</mark> adds dualities. This duality, combined with <mark class="pink">wisdom</mark> and <mark class="pink">love</mark> is the key.

  <p>Cowgirl as element of <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">control</mark>. Alone in the West. Having duty. Living by the <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">Code</mark>.</p><br>
  <p>You're my <mark class="DeepSkyBlue"> mirror.</mark></p><br>
  <p>So when will I see you next?</p><br>
  <p>Caloric Deficit.</p><br>
  <p>Myth <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">commodified</mark> into garment. Allegory activated as <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">protective gear</mark>.</p><br>
  <p>That shit was genius...but it was a one of one.</p><br>
  <p>Camo hanky code. I wear <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">realtree.</mark></p><br>
  <p>Everything here was built for <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">self preservation</mark>, how could we, how could I have been any different?</p><br>
  <p>Multiplicitous self-hood.</p><br>
  <p>It's a rough job. But somebodies got to do it.</p><br>
  <p>Erers <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">charlat√°n</mark>? Eres <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">estafador</mark>?</p><br>
  <p>I see by your <mark class="DeepSkyBlue">outfit</mark> that you are a cowboy. These words he did say as I boldly stepped by. Come sit down beside me, and hear my sad story. Got shot in the breast, and I know I must die.</p>
